# MasterMath 2021: Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of Large Scale Systems

This is my repository for the assignments and project of the MasterMath course *Numerical Bifurcation Analysis of Large Scale Systems* during the summer semester of 2021.

If you're also taking this course and have found this repository, please do yourself a favor and don't just copy my solutions. The exercises are doable and actually quite fun if you get them to work.
